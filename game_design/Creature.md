##About the magic creature.
1. Creature should have different names.
2. They can be set in different level. For instance, level 1 is entrence, can be easily defeated, where level 10 is the Boss level, which would need better equipment to fight against.
3. Also, like weaponry, creature should have various special feature, which indicates that we can use the same file to store the feature and the skill. Those two should have same array structure.
4. Creature should have their own color to identify themselves to player. Since can we convert level into color, the addtional status is not necessary.
5. We better develop a HP bar. But unlike other games, we don't use specific number. Instead, we could use 100/100%. Player can restore energy once the battle is over.
